# Reactdemo_JS
First we install the react app with a name of user choice. 
Before that we need to create a folder to store this app.
To create that folder, we use the command - " npx create-react-app foldername". For this app, I used "npx create-react-app helloworld --use-npm".
Then it takes some time to create all the required dependencies, then the folder is created.
Next step now, is to install the app in that folder. Open the folder in VSCode and open "App.js" to see and edit your code.
Type your React code in that space. Then save it.
Now it's time to run the code.
We use the command - "npm start" which then open the chrome and allows the user to see their app.
If you want to change the directory, we use the command - "cd .\ folder-name \" in the VS code terminal. 
And then we can use "npm start" to launch the react app.
